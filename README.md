# Blockchain Sports

The porject is built on a [frontier template](https://github.com/PureStake/frontier) â€”
[FRAME](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame)-based
[Substrate](https://substrate.io) node with the Ethereum RPC support, ready for
hacking :rocket:




## Build & Run

To build the chain, execute the following commands from the project root:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

To execute the chain, run:

```
$ ./target/release/sportchain-node --dev
```




## Genesis Configuration

In order to view an EVM account, use the `Developer` tab of the Polkadot UI
`Settings` app to define the EVM `Account` type as below:

```json
{
    "AccountId": "EthereumAccountId",
    "Address": "AccountId",
    "Balance": "u128",
    "RefCount": "u8",
    "LookupSource": "AccountId",
    "Account": {
        "nonce": "U256",
        "balance": "u128"
    },
    "EthTransaction": "LegacyTransaction",
    "DispatchErrorModule": "DispatchErrorModuleU8",
    "EthereumSignature": {
        "r": "H256",
        "s": "H256",
        "v": "U8"
    },
    "ExtrinsicSignature": "EthereumSignature",
    "TxPoolResultContent": {
        "pending": "HashMap<H160, HashMap<U256, PoolTransaction>>",
        "queued": "HashMap<H160, HashMap<U256, PoolTransaction>>"
    },
    "TxPoolResultInspect": {
        "pending": "HashMap<H160, HashMap<U256, Summary>>",
        "queued": "HashMap<H160, HashMap<U256, Summary>>"
    },
    "TxPoolResultStatus": {
        "pending": "U256",
        "queued": "U256"
    },
    "Summary": "Bytes",
    "PoolTransaction": {
        "hash": "H256",
        "nonce": "U256",
        "blockHash": "Option<H256>",
        "blockNumber": "Option<U256>",
        "from": "H160",
        "to": "Option<H160>",
        "value": "U256",
        "gasPrice": "U256",
        "gas": "U256",
        "input": "Bytes"
    }
}
```

Use the `Developer` app's `RPC calls` tab to query 
`eth > getBalance(address, number)` with Alice's EVM account ID
(`0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558`); the value that is returned
should look something like:

```text
x: eth.getBalance
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455
```

## Other Prefunded Accounts

Running VPP in development mode will pre-fund several well-known addresses
that (mostly) contain the letters "th" in their names to remind you that they
are for ethereum-compatible usage. These addresses are derived from Substrate's
canonical mnemonic: __bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race
lonely fit walk__ followed by the name of an account (i.e `bottom drive obey
lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alith`)

## Configuring Ethereum Wallet For Development

The node should run locally in `--dev` mode.

Then you need to configure the network this way:

- chain ID is __2340__
- chain name is __sportchain__
- currency name is __BCSport Token__
- currency symbol is __BCS__
- currency decimals is __18__
- RPC URL is __http://localhost:9944/__ (or change appropriately to where you
  deploy the node)

## ink! contracts

To generate an initial smart contract, execute the following commands from the project root:

```
$ cargo contract new <conract_name>
```

To compile smart contract, run in the project directory:

```
$ cargo contract build --release
```

## Example 1: ERC20 Contract Deployment using EVM dispatchable

The following steps are also available as a 
[Typescript script](examples/contract-erc20) using Polkadot JS SDK.


### Step 1: Contract creation

The [`truffle`](examples/contract-erc20/truffle) directory contains a
[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) project that defines 
[an ERC-20 token](examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.sol). 
For convenience, this repository also contains 
[the compiled bytecode of this token contract](examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.json#L259), 
which can be used to deploy it to the Substrate blockchain.

> Further reading:
> [the ERC-20 token standard](https://github.com/danforbes/danforbes/blob/master/writings/eth-dev.md#EIP-20-ERC-20-Token-Standard)

Use the Polkadot UI `Extrinsics` app to deploy the contract from Alice's account
(submit the extrinsic as a signed transaction) using `evm > create` with the
following parameters:

```
source: 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558
init: <raw contract bytecode, a very long hex value>
value: 0
gas_limit: 4294967295
gas_price: 1
nonce: <empty> {None}
```

The values for `gas_limit` and `gas_price` were chosen for convenience and have
little inherent or special meaning. Note that `None` for the nonce will
increment the known nonce for the source account, starting from `0x0`, you may
manually set this but will get an "evm.InvalidNonce" error if not set correctly.

Once the extrinsic is in a block, navigate to the `Network` -> `Explorer` tab in
the UI, or open up the browser console to see that the EVM pallet has fired a
`Created` event with an `address` field that provides the address of the
newly-created contract:

```bash
# console:
... {"phase":{"applyExtrinsic":2},"event":{"index":"0x0901","data":["0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f"]} ...

# UI:
evm.Created
A contract has been created at given [address]
   H160: 0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f
```

In this case, however, it is trivial to
[calculate this value](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/46960):
`0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f`. That is because EVM contract
account IDs are determined solely by the ID and nonce of the contract creator's
account and, in this case, both of those values are well-known
(`0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558` and `0x0`, respectively).


### Step 2: Check Contract Storage

Use the `Chain State` UI tab to query `evm > accountCodes` for both Alice's and
the contract's account IDs; notice that Alice's account code is empty and the
contract's is equal to the bytecode of the Solidity contract.

The ERC-20 contract that was deployed inherits from
[the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)
and extends its capabilities by adding
[a constructor that mints a maximum amount of tokens to the contract creator](examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.sol#L8).
Use the `Chain State` app to query `evm > accountStorage` and view the value
associated with Alice's account in the `_balances` map of the ERC-20 contract;
use the ERC-20 contract address (`0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f`)
as the first parameter and the storage slot to read as the second parameter
(`0x045c0350b9cf0df39c4b40400c965118df2dca5ce0fbcf0de4aafc099aea4a14`). The
value that is returned should be
`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.

The storage slot was calculated using
[a provided utility](utils/README.md#--erc20-slot-slot-address). 
(Slot 0 and alice address: `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558`)

### Step 3: Contract Usage

Use the `Developer` -> `Extrinsics` tab to invoke the 
`transfer(address, uint256)` function on the ERC-20 contract with `evm > call` 
and transfer some of the ERC-20 tokens from Alice to Bob.

```text
target: 0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f
source: 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558
input: 0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000008eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc528761369300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dd
value: 0
gas_limit: 4294967295
gas_price: 1
```

The value of the `input` parameter is an EVM ABI-encoded function call that was
calculated using [the Remix web IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org); it consists of
a function selector (`0xa9059cbb`) and the arguments to be used for the function
invocation. In this case, the arguments correspond to Bob's EVM account ID
(`0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693`) and the number of tokens to be
transferred (`0xdd`, or 221 in hex).

> [the EVM ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html)


### Step 4: Check Bob Contract Storage

After the extrinsic has finalized, use the `Chain State` app to query 
`evm > accountStorage` to see the ERC-20 balances for both Alice and Bob.
